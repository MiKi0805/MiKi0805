            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Michael, but usually called Miki <em>(pronounce&nbsp;Micky in English)</em>&nbsp;and I'm a passionate indie game developers. I'm from Indonesia, but currently living in Faroe Islands, Denmark.&nbsp;I've been loving game developing since I was 11 years old, and start producing and uploading game on my late 12 years old. The biggest project I have or currently working is 'Catching the Wind' and more about that later!</p>
            <h2>Socials</h2>
            <p>I also have a small YouTube channel to upload my regular hobbies. My hobby is not just a game development, but I'm also interested in engineering that integrates Arduino as the controller. If you interested in such things, come and visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@miki-inno" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
            <p>I also have a Discord server, if you want to hang out come&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/4yFwxDpaqX" target="_blank">join</a>!</p>
            <h2>My games</h2>
            <p>Most of my game are developed during a game jam. I'll always make sure to separate them from my personal project. The games that I've made are mostly build to be played on browser, and I think I'll keep it that way.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, and about 'Catching the Wind' or CTW for short. CTW is a game that me and 3 other people developed during GMTK game jam 2023. I'm currently working to continue the game beyond a game jam game and&nbsp;turning it to&nbsp;a commercial game with two persons in the team.&nbsp;</p>
